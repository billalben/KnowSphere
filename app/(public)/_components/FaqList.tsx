    question: "What's your refund policy?",
    answer:
      "Every paid course comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee. If the course isn't right for you, reach out within 30 days of purchase and we'll issue a full refund — no questions asked.",

      "Yes. Finish every lesson in a paid course and your certificate of completion is generated automatically. It's shareable on LinkedIn, downloadable as PDF, and includes a unique verification URL.",
